# Introduction
The depression dataset contains data aimed at analyzing, understanding and predicting depression levels in a population. It include features such as demographic information (age, gender), lifestyle habits (sleep duration), mental health history, and responses to standardized depression scales. 
In this project, I analyze and visualize this dataset to bring fore some of the subtle relationship that exist between the variables in the data. 

# Data Source
This data was sourced from Kaggle.com

# Data Cleaning Process
The data was comprehensively evaluated to identify potential data quality issues and structural anomalies. However, no issues were found in the dataset. The columns "Category" and "Age Cat" were added to the original columns present in the dataset.
