# Introduction
The depression dataset contains data aimed at analyzing and understanding depression levels in a population. It include features such as demographic information (age, gender), lifestyle habits (sleep duration), mental health history, and responses to standardized depression scales. 
In this project, I analyze this dataset to bring fore some of the subtle relationship that exist between the variables in the data. 

# Data Source
This data was sourced from Kaggle.com

# Data Cleaning Process
The data was comprehensively evaluated to identify potential data quality issues and structural anomalies. However, no issues were found in the dataset. The columns "Category" and "Age Cat" were added to the original columns present in the dataset.

1. Students with unhealthy feeding habit had the highest count of depressed individual.
2. The least count of depressed students were those that studied/worked for 4-6 hours.
3. The highest count of depressed students were observed to be from the city of Kalyan.
4. The highest count of depressed students were observed to be in the age range of 20-29.

# Recommendations
1. Students should be sensitized and encouraged to inculcate healthy feeding habit.
2. Further analysis should be done to highlight the possible causes of high rate of depression among students of age range 20-29.
